* As a user who is logged in, I should be able to see the Team view.
* As a user who is logged in, I should be able to see a log out button

### Routing
* As a user if I click the TEAM link in the navbar, I should navigate to '/team' and see an h1 tag that says 'Team'.
* As a user if I click the NEW link in the navbar, I should navigate to '/new' and see an h1 tag that says 'Add a Player'.

### CREATE Players
* As an authenticated user, I should be able to click the NEW link in the navbar that displays a form to add a new player.
